 * - Use one selector per line when a ruleset has a group of selectors separated
 *   by commas.
 * - The opening brace ({) of a rulesetâ€™s declaration block should be on the
 *   same line as the selector (or the same line as the last selector in a group
 *   of selectors.) The opening brace should include a single space before it.
 * - Place the closing brace (}) of a ruleset in the same column as the first
 *   character in the selector of the ruleset.
 * - Each declaration should be indented one level relative to its selector.
